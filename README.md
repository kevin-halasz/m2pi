## Using

To avoid getting a really messy repo, open a new branch before pushing new code

## Contents

### `data/`

Sufficiently small data files can go here, so everyone has easy access. However,
github is not a good place to store large data files. Anything more than 5MB
should be shared as a .zip file in slack

Data files:
- `census_lf`: A collection of .csv files containing labour force information
  from the Canadian census 1996-2011
- `lfs_north_coast.csv`: Labour Force Survey data for the North Coast and 
  Nechako Economic Region of British Columbia from March 2006 to June 2022
  
### `src/`

This is where you want to put your scripts
